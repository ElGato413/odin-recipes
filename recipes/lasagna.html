   <h1><strong>Lasagna Ingredients</strong></h1>
   
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Cheese Filling:</strong>For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or replace it with cottage cheese. </li>
<li><strong>Meat:</strong> I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor, or make my homemade Italian sausage.</li>
<li><strong>Sauce:</strong>To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao’s for flavor.</li>
<li><strong>Spinach (variation):</strong>Spinach is optional but delicious in lasagna. For spinach lasagna, thaw 10oz of frozen spinach, squeeze out the moisture, and add it along with the cheese layer.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>How to Make Lasagna</strong></h1>
<p>While homemade lasagna may have a few steps, each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal!</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Boil pasta:</strong>In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles <strong><em>per the recipe below.</em></strong> </li>
    <li><strong>Prepare meat sauce:</strong>Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce (I love this brand) & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
<li><strong>Combine cheese mixture:</strong>Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
<li><strong>Layer & bake:</strong>Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.</li>
