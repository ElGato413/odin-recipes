<p>It couldn't be easier to grill hamburger patties! You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>

<p>Prepare the grill grate by cleaning it and brushing it lightly with oil. Heat a charcoal or gas grill to medium-high heat, then grill the patties on each side (the length of time depends on the level of doneness you're after).
